  <p>Montpelier is fortunate to still have family owned businesses. In far too many cities and suburbs they are crowded out by faceless franchises. We don’t want that fate in our town any time in the future.</p>

  <p>Saturdays, In front of my pet shop on State, Montpelier children age 6-13 will become business people — selling what they have baked or what they have grown. They will be marketing. You will read about them in Front Porch Forum on their parents’ Facebook page. They will make their own signs. They will be expected to pay back their backers (likely parents) for materials as they learn the difference between gross and net.. Hopefully, catching the bug that will populate shops like mine in 2040-2050 with great new ideas and continue to hold McDonalds at bay..</p>

  <p>Please make it a habit to go out of your way to patronize their table in front of The Quirky Pet late Saturday mornings and early after noon. Buy something. Your purchase might be small but it won’t be insignificant .It will mean a great deal to an impressionable young person. That’s important.</p>

  <p>Our first Next-Gen entrepreneurs are two enterprising young ladies from Union Elementary who call themselves Lady Bites. I’ll preview them later in the week.</p>
