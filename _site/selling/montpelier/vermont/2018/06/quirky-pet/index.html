<blockquote>
  <p>This Saturday marks the very first week of this summer’s Next-Generation Young Entrepreneur Program. Michi and Jovie, enterprising and engaging Union Elementary second graders will take center stage in front of The Quirky Pet from 11:00-1:00 selling baked goods and delicious lemonade.</p>

  <p>I hope Montpelier folks lmake it a point to find their way to the table in front of the Quirky Pet on State near Main and start the business careers of our two ‘Lady Bites’ off on a positive note. If you are going to the Farmer’s Market… stop by. If you are doing the Human Society Walk…. pick up something.</p>

  <p>Keep Michi and Jovie in mind!</p>

  <p>Also, future Young Entrepreneurs, please stop in the store for an application!!!!</p>
