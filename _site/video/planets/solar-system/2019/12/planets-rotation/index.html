<blockquote>
  <p>Planetary scientist James Oâ€™Donoghue made this cool little visualization of the rotation speeds of the planets of the solar system. You can see Jupiter making one full rotation every ~10 hours, Earth &amp; Mars about every 24 hours, and Venus rotating once every 243 days. He also did a version where all the planets rotate the same way (Venus &amp; Uranus actually rotate the other way).</p>
