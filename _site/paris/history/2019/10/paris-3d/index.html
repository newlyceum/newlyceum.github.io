  <p>In 2012, a company called Dassault Systèmes launched an interactive application that allowed you to move about in a 3D historical reconstruction of Paris at different points in its history. The application seems to have fallen into disrepair so that you can’t actually use it, but the 13-minute video above offers a tour through several time periods, including:</p>

  <p>52 BCE. The area was home to a Celtic group called the Parisii, just before the Romans conquered the settlement.</p>

  <p>2nd century CE. The Romans ruled here until 486 CE; they called the city Lutetia.</p>

  <p>1165-1350 CE. The medieval period. Paris was one of the largest cities in Europe.</p>

  <p>1789 CE. A look at the Bastille during the French Revolution.</p>

  <p>1887-1889 CE. The construction of the Eiffel Tower for the 1889 World’s Fair. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 40 years (eclipsed by the Chrysler Building).</p>
