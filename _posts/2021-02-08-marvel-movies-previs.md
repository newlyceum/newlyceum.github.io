> This is the entire infamously loved and hated Legend Of Zelda Animated Series.. and then some. This almost 5 hour video includes all 13 LOZ episodes (1989), the 4 Captain N episodes which Link & Zelda made an appearance (1990), the Link vs. Pit Anime (Super Smash Bros. Wii U Promo 2014), and A Link To The Past episode 1 by Aeipathy Industries (2014).
