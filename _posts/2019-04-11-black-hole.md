> No single telescope is powerful enough to take a picture of a black hole. So a coalition of international scientists created the Event Horizon Telescope by setting up a network of eight radio telescopes. The connection of these telescopes was powerful enough to capture a black hole 3 million times the size of Earth.

> It took scientists almost a decade to get this breakthrough. Not only did they have to build observatories all over the world, but they also went through painstaking efforts to perfectly synchronize the telescopes to achieve the highest resolution possible.

Picture one side of the Earth facing where they knew the black hole to be, and all these telescopes coordinated precisely by atomic clocks, so that they take their part of the picture at the same time. To take a picture of something so far away, they had to act as one telescope the size of the earth.

> There’s a reason why we’ve never seen a picture of the black hole at the center of our galaxy: despite its huge mass, Sagittarius A* is actually very small and is surrounded by bright gas and swirling material.

> Taking a picture of the shadow cast by Sagittarius A*’s event horizon is like “taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the moon” from the surface of the Earth.

> In science speak, the shadow cast by Sagittarius A* is expected to be around 50 microarcseconds wide when viewed from the Earth. An arcsecond is 1/3600 of a degree. And there are 1 million microarcseconds in an arcsecond. Again: The shadow cast by Sagittarius A* is tiny. Compared to the full moon, the shadow cast by Sagittarius A* is 37.2 million times smaller.

To take a picture of something that small, you need a huge telescope, one the size of the Earth.

The picture was taken in April, 2017.

> But the task of this synchronization is really hard. Part of the reason why this announcement has been two years in the making is because the data files were too big to be transferred by digital means. The hard drives had to be flown from the observatories to get processed. And the dataset in Antarctica was inaccessible for months due to harsh winter conditions.

> Another reason is that the scientists need to account for the rotation of the Earth. The Earth rotates, meaning the individual observatories making up the Event Horizon Telescope are moving too, introducing a type of blur into the data. It took extremely precise atomic clocks at each of the observatory sites to ensure all the data would line up and the resulting image would be clear.
