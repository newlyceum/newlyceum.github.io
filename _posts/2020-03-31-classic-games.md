> [Classic Reload](https://classicreload.com/) was setup for preservation of 6,000+ old retro abandonware games and abandoned OS/interfaces that you can play DOS games online right in your web browser for education and research purposes.

I spent a lot of finished-with-my-work classroom free time playing games like Oregon Trail, [Number Munchers](https://classicreload.com/number-munchers.html), and [Odell Lake](https://classicreload.com/search?search_api_views_fulltext=odell+lake).

You should use Number Munchers to practice multiplication. Choose Multiples from the of options.
