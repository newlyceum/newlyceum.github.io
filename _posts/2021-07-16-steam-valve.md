> However, Valve already has a history of releasing hardware and failing to support it. In 2013, Valve announced its Steam Machine, rolling out its own operating system on premade PCs built like consoles. It was considered a failure very early on, and reports from that time suggest Valve wasn’t responsive to manufacturers. Games also ran poorly on the SteamOS compared to Microsoft’s Windows.
