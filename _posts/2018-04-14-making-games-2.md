Fred says:

> I make games at TheGameCrafter or Print Play Games. Each have their strengths. TGC lets you do it all and sell them. They also run contests which help with creativity.

> I buy most of my games from CoolStuffInc, but itâ€™s $100 minimum to get free shipping (which is worth it for board games). Avoid Amazon if you can. They have a counterfeiting problem, among the usual stuff.
