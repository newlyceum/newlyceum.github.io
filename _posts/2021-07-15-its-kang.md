> Jonathan Majors, who's been cast to play Kang in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, played a Variant of a 31st Century scientist whose exploration into the multiverse sparked a massive Multiversal War (thanks to some of his more evil, power-hungry Variants). In Episode 6, this Variant went by "He Who Remains."
