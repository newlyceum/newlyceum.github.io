What does "en passant" mean in French?

In chess, when they added the rule that a pawn can move two squares on its first move, they realized that you could do that to avoid your pawn being taken by a pawn if you only moved one square. So if you move your pawn two squares and land alongside a pawn that would have otherwise taken yours, that pawn can pass yours and take it on the next move.
