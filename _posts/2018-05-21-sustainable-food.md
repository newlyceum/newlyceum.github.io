Here's a college major that includes cooking and sustainability, in VT.

UPDATE: Here's [another sustainable food](http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/sustainable-agriculture-food-systems/) major at Green Mountain College, also in VT. Nearby Goddard has [a degree in Sustainability](https://www.goddard.edu/academics/ba-sustainability/), too, though it's not food-focused.
