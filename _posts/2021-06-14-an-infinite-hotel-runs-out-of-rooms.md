> This video from Veritasium is a nice explanation of the mathematician David Hilbert’s [paradox of the Grand Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel), which illustrates that a hotel with an infinite number of rooms can still accommodate new guests even when it’s full. Until it can’t, that is. See also [Steven Strogatz’s explanation of Hilbert’s infinite hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE9fl6tUWhc) and how Georg Cantor’s discovery of different types of infinities complicated the hotel’s hospitality.
